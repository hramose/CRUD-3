# Having trouble using Sone?

No documentation can be 100% complete and Sone's is no different, sorry for that. Post your question there and please include:
- (A) what you did
- (B) what you expected to happen
- (C) what happened
- (D) what have you already tried to fix it?


# Idea for a new feature?

**[Open an issue](https://github.com/laravel-sone/crud) and tell the community you are willing to submit a PR.** We usually end up with better solutions when we talk about it and everybody pitches in with their opinion. Plus, some features might be better presented as a separate package, a tutorial or a code snippet.

PR Rules:

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
